Deepfake video detection
Problem Statement:
This project proposes a deepfake detection system aimed at identifying manipulated videos by analyzing their visual and metadata characteristics. With the increasing misuse of deepfake technology to produce highly realistic but deceptive content, it has become critical to develop a robust solution that ensures the authenticity of digital media.

The system leverages advanced techniques such as video frame analysis and machine learning to differentiate between real and fake videos. By detecting inconsistencies introduced during deepfake creation, the system performs tasks such as classifying content as "FAKE" or "REAL" and providing insights into manipulation patterns. This innovative approach seeks to enhance digital media integrity, address ethical concerns, and mitigate the adverse societal impacts of deepfake technology.
